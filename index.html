              <br>
             Benefits currently considered for public charge include:
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>SSI</li>
  <li>General Assistance</li>
  <li>CalWORKS</li>
  <li>CAPI</li>
</ul> 
Additionally, long-term Medi-Cal care such as nursing homes will be considered. 

<br>Proposed changes to public charge will likely consider:
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>CalFresh/food stamps</li>
  <li>Non-emergency Medi-Cal</li>
  <li> Federal housing/Section 8</li>
</ul> <br>
   These changes might never be made. If they are, you will have time to stop these benefits before they are in place.
